        the_ocalhoun's creating a really neat scenario pack for Roller Coaster Tycoon. I've been
        slowly playing through it, but finding the indivdual scenarios has been cumbersome.
        So until they're complete and they're released as a complete thing, here's the list mostly
        up to date:
  .mx-sm-4.row-grid
    each scenario in scenarios.slice().reverse()
      .card.bg-white.shadow-sm
        .card-img
          img(src=scenario.img, alt="preview")
          h5.card-title= scenario.title
        .card-body
          p.card-text= scenario.description
          .flex-grow-1
          .card-links
            each link in scenario.links
              a(href=link.href, rel='noopener noreferrer', target='_blank')= link.title

  .container.my-4.text-center
